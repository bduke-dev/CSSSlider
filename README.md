# CSS_Slider
A simple image slider coded completely in CSS. This is done to achieve the most cross compatibility among browsers.
By avoiding the use of JavaScript the slider does not rely on the device having it, allowing it to work in about all browsers.

## Features
- Automatic timed advancement, each slide is 4s long
- Play/Pause button
- Forward/Previous arrow advancement
- Page indicators that double as page advancement

### Notes
- The slider requires exactly 6 images. It can be modified to work with more or less, however that will require a lot of work. 
Using anything besides 6 images would mean recalculating the timing of all animations, as well as, the sizing of the sider.
- This slider is set up for full screen images, can be modified to work in smaller formats.
